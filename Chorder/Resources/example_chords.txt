*F *G *E
Stray! Stray!
*E *C
In the cold breeze that I walk along
*D *A
The memories of generations burn within me
*E *C
Been forever since I cried the pain and sorrow
*D *A
I live and die, proud of my people gaining
*E *D
I'm here standing at the edge
*C *A
Starring up at where the moon should be
*Dm *Em *F *G
*Bm
Stray!
*G *A
No regrets 'cause I got nothin to lose
*Em *F#m *Bm
Ever stray!
*G *A
So I'm gonna live my life as I choose
*D *G
Until I fall..
*F *G *F
Stray! Stray!
*F *G *E
Stray! Stray!
*E *C
In the white freeze, I never spoke of tears
*D *A
Or opened up to anyone including myself
*E *C
I would like to find a way to open to you
*D *A
Been awhile, don't know if I remember how to
*E *D
I'm here waiting on the edge
*C *A
Would I be alright showing myself to you?
*Dm *Em *F *G
It's always been so hard to do..
*Bm
Stray!
*G *A
No regrets 'cause I got nothin to lose
*Em *F#m *Bm
Ever stray!
*G *A
So I'm gonna live my life as I choose
*D *G
Until I fall...
*F *G *F
Stray! Stray!
*F *G *F
Stray! Stray!
*F *G *Dm *F *G
Stray! Stray!
*G *A
Is there a place left there for me
*F
Somewhere that I belong
*Eb *G
Or will I always live this way...?
*Bm
Always stray
*G *A
No regrets 'cause I got nothin to lose
*Em *F#m *Bm
Ever stray!
*G *A
So I'm gonna live my life as I choose
*D *G
Cause all things fall
*F *G *F
Stray! Stray!
*F *G *F
Stray! Stray!
*F *G *Dm *F *G
Stray! Stray!
